# Prework Study Guide

## Description

- I wanted to get my feet wet by learning and practicing some of the skills that will be needed for the bootcamp and beyond.
- This project was built in order to learn the fundamentals for HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git and put them all together.
- This project will allow me to record notes for these four topics as I go through the bootcamp, and they can be referred to later in my career.
- I learned how HTML is the structure of a website, CSS is the styling of the HTML structure, and Javascript allows you to build on top of the structre and make it interactive. Git allows you to build this technology out in a safe manner.

Each section in the study guide can be used to record and refer to notes about the technologies used to build websites. There are four sections labelled HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. There is also a script to help you determine what subject to study first. This is viewable in the Console section in Chrome's DevTools.
